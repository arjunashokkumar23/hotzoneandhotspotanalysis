## Hotzone and Hotspot analysis for geospatial data

The project's primary goal is to conduct several geographic queries on the database of a prominent peer-to-peer taxi company. The database includes geographic information as well as the current location of their consumers. The purpose of this project is to extract and perform queries on this data to offer operational short-term and strategic long-term choices. Phase 2 of this project necessitates programming and developing two different hot spot analyses 1) Hot zone analysis and 2) Hot cell/Hotspot analysis.
